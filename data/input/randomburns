You know...,If I agreed with you, we would both be wrong.
I am trying to see things from your point of view but, I just can't seem to get my head that far up my ass!
You don't get out much do you?
A lot of people say I am a poor judge of character, But I think you're alright!
I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.
What color is the sky in your world?
I am busy right now. Can I ignore you some other time?
Did you ever wonder what life would be like if you did have enough oxygen at birth?
And your cry baby, whiney assed response is...?
Are you always a dumbass or just when I'm around?
Calling you stupid would be an insult to stupid people!
Ok, I will make you a deal. If you'll be smarter, I'll be nicer.
